# coronainfectiontracking
Corona Archive is an application which aims to track Corona Infections via contact tracing. We aim to do this by registering people when they enter a business in collaboration with business owners, marking people as infected in collaboration with hospitals, and contacting people who are likely to have infection with the help of our admins.
